# FreeNet 🌐

**FreeNet** is an open-source experimental browser that uses [Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum) to explore and participate in a **free, decentralized internet**.  
It aims to give users a censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer alternative to the traditional web, where everyone can host, share, and access information without relying on centralized servers.

FreeNet is still in active development — the repository currently provides **Windows** and **macOS** builds, with the full source code coming soon.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Decentralized Networking** – Built on Reticulum, a resilient peer-to-peer communication stack.  
- **Cross-Platform** – Runs on both Windows and macOS (Linux support planned).  
- **Open Source** – Transparent, community-driven development.  
- **Freedom-Oriented** – No central authorities, no gatekeepers, no dependencies on corporate infrastructure.  
- **Custom Content Hosting (Planned)** – Add your own `index.html` to your system’s `AppData` (Windows) or `Application Support` (macOS) to host and share with others directly through FreeNet.  
- **Lightweight & Minimalist** – Designed to be fast, simple, and accessible to everyone.

## 🌍 Why FreeNet?

The modern internet is increasingly centralized, censored, and controlled by large corporations and governments.  
FreeNet is a step toward reclaiming digital independence by enabling a truly free network where:

- Anyone can publish content without permission.  
- Communities can connect without surveillance or gatekeeping.  
- Access is resilient, even in restrictive environments.
