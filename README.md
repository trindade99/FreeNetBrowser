FreeNet 🌐

FreeNet is an open-source experimental browser that uses Reticulum to explore and participate in a free, decentralized internet. It aims to give users a censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer alternative to the traditional web, where everyone can host, share, and access information without relying on centralized servers.

FreeNet is still in active development — the repository currently provides Windows and macOS builds, with the full source code coming soon.

🔥 Key Features
	•	Decentralized Networking – Built on Reticulum, a resilient peer-to-peer communication stack.
	•	Cross-Platform – Runs on both Windows and macOS (Linux support planned).
	•	Open Source – Transparent, community-driven development.
	•	Freedom-Oriented – No central authorities, no gatekeepers, no dependencies on corporate infrastructure.

🌍 Why FreeNet?

The modern internet is increasingly centralized, censored, and controlled by large corporations and governments. FreeNet is a step toward reclaiming digital independence by enabling a truly free network where:
	•	Anyone can publish content without permission.
	•	Communities can connect without surveillance or gatekeeping.
	•	Access is resilient, even in restrictive environments.

🚧 Roadmap
	•	Source code release
	•	Linux support
	•	Improved UI/UX
	•	Plugins/extensions for richer decentralized apps
